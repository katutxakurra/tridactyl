# Tridactyl changelog

## Release 1.13.0 / {{ file.mtime }}

- `editor` now includes the hostname of the site you are on in the temporary filename
    - this is mostly so that you can set up syntax highlighting in Vim, e.g,
    - `au BufReadPost *github.com* set syntax=pandoc`

- **Potentially breaking change**: pipes in `composite` now send return values to the following ex command. Use semi-colons if you want the old behaviour back (see `bind D`).

## Release 1.12.0 / 2018-05-13

- Add container support
    - `hint` will now open links in the current container
    - there is a new setting, `set tabopencontaineraware [false|true]`, which will make `tabopen` open new tabs in the current container
- Add extra `<CA-Esc>` bind to toggle ignore mode by popular demand
- Fix errors related to missing native messenger on Firefox launch

## Release 1.11.2 / 2018-05-11

- Hotfix to prevent "config undefined" errors on browser start if no rc file was found
    - It was mysteriously only reproducible sometimes...
- Make newtab changelog a bit wider

## Release 1.11.1 / 2018-05-11

- **Add "tridactylrc" support**
    - Stick a bunch of commands you want to run at startup in one of:
        - `$XDG_CONFIG_DIR/tridactyl/tridactylrc`
        - `~/.config/tridactyl/tridactylrc`
        - `~/.tridactylrc`
    - [Example file available here](https://github.com/cmcaine/tridactyl/blob/master/.tridactylrc)
    - You can run any file you want with `source [absolute path to file]`. Bonus points if you can think of something sensible to do with `source` in an `autocmd`.
    - If you want vim-style configuration where nothing persists except that which is in the rc file, simply add `sanitise tridactyllocal tridactylsync` to the top of your rc file.
    - Only whole-line comments are supported at the moment, in the VimL style where lines start with a quote mark: "

- Native messenger updated to 0.1.3
    - Add rc file reader
    - Add ability to read environment variables
    - Make read understand ~ and environment variables (used in `source`)

- Readme updated
    - Add statistics page and `guiset`

- Bug fixes
    - `guiset` can now cope with multiple Firefox instances running simultaneously provided they are started with profiles explicitly via the command line.

- Deprecations
    - Remove buffers,tabs as promised
    - Inform people pressing `I` of the new bind

## Release 1.11.0 / 2018-05-09

- You can now edit the Firefox GUI from Tridactyl with `guiset`. You must restart Firefox after using `guiset` to see the effects.
    - e.g, `guiset gui none` or `guiset gui full`.
    - see all the options with `help guiset` and following the links.
    - **Only minimally tested. Back up your precious userChrome.css if you care about it!**

- You can now choose to bypass [CSP](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Content_Security_Policy) on all sites with `set csp clobber`. If you change your mind, just `unset csp`, and restart your browser.
    - This, for example, allows Tridactyl to run on pages such as https://raw.githubusercontent.com/cmcaine/tridactyl/master/CHANGELOG.md, but it could also allow other scripts to run on pages, making the Internet as dangerous as it was about 2 or 3 years ago before CSP was introduced.
    - Once this [bug](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1267027) in Firefox is fixed, you won't have to clobber CSP.

- Tridactyl will no longer update while the browser is running in an attempt to fix issues where the add-on would be unresponsive after an update; instead, it will only update on browser launch.
    - This includes manual updates via `about:addons`. You'll need to restart the browser after clicking "Check for updates".

- `set newtab news.bbc.co.uk` etc. now looks much less janky

- Minor new features
    - Add !s alias for silent exclaim
    - `termite` and `terminator` support with `set editorcmd auto`
    - Allow binding <Esc> (not recommended...)
    - AMO explains why we need each new permission
    - Native messenger documentation improved, making it clear that we haven't reimplemented IRC in the browser.

- Minor bug fixes
    - Remove pixel gap under command bar (#442)
    - Native installer no longer requires pip and supports Debian's `which`
    - Help page links are more legible on rubbish screens
    - Turn 'q' and 'qall' into aliases
    - Fix typo regarding binding of special keys on help page
    - `focusinput` is now better at finding elements to focus

## Release 1.10.1 / 2018-05-04

- Add tabcloseallto{right,left} bound to `gx0` and `gx$`
- Update tab page and other documentation to reflect new ignore mode binding
- Fix #474: you can open a handful of about:* pages without the native messenger again
- Improve feedback when native messenger is not correctly installed   

## Release 1.10.0 / 2018-05-03

- Native messenger (for OSX/Linux only, for now)! On Linux/OSXRun `:installnative` to install, then:
    - `<Ctrl-I>` in a text field will open Vim, probably. Set it with `set editorcmd` but make sure that the command stays in the foreground till the programme is exited.
    - Not all text fields work yet (esp CodeMirror), so make sure you test it before writing war and peace.
    - `:! [shell command]` or `:exclaim [shell command]` will run the command and give you STDOUT/STDERR back in the command line.
        - You can't use composite and shell pipes together yet.
        - Anything that works in `/bin/sh` should work
            - If you want to use a different shell, just make your own alias:
                -  `command ! exclaim fish -c` (but be aware that some shells require quotes around arguments given to -c)
    - Requires a new permission to use the native messenger (and to use Tridactyl at all, unfortunately)
    - `nativeopen` will try to open a new tab or window using the native messenger. It is used in `{,win,tab}open` automatically when you try to open about:* or file:* URIs.

- Add `hint -W [exstr]` to execute exstr on hint's href
    - `hint -W exclaim_quiet mpv` works particularly well.

- **Breaking change**: change ignore mode binds to be symmetric and resolve Jupyter conflict
    - Ignore mode is now bound to `<S-Insert>` to enter and leave it.
    - Previous binds of `I` and `<S-Esc>` are unbound

- More scrolling fixes
    - `G`/`gg` will now work on more sites

- Completion improvements
    - History completion performance improved
        - If you find you are getting worse results than usual, increase `set historyresults` to, e.g, 500.
    - Fix #446: you can now edit completions you select with space
    - Completions will now pan to show you what you have selected

- Mode indicator is now print friendly (#453)!

- Fiddled with `help` theme
    - We've tried to make it look a bit more like the old Vimperator help pages and have hidden some useless or misleading bits that TypeDoc produced, such as the return values.

- `viewsource` improved
    - Now bound to `gf` by default
    - Fix viewsource elem not always covering the whole page
    - Remove viewsource elem on spa history changes

- Bind help to F1

- Changelog changelog:
    - Change changelog date format
    - Changelog: use standard case: changelog.md -> CHANGELOG.md
    - Changelog: move to the standard location
    - Changelog: add dates

- Misc fixes
    - Fix :open <empty string>. Fixes #421
    - Filter AltGraph keys. Fixes #430
    - Explain that the hint tags are typed in lowercase even though they are displayed in uppercase

    - Simply `set noiframeon [space separated URLs]` to blacklist URLs
- This will hopefully be our final release before the native messenger for OSX and Linux is merged.
